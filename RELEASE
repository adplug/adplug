Release procedure
-----------------

Before release:

 * Ensure version numbers are correct in configure.ac, src/version.h, and
   appveyor.yml.  They should already be set to the version number of the next
   release, but may need altering e.g. if an unplanned bugfix release is made.

 * Update file list in adplug.qpg

 * Update NEWS with changes since last release

 * Create new tag: `git tag adplug-1.2.3` and `git push origin adplug-1.2.3`

 * Run 'make distcheck' to create .tar.bz2 archive for release

After release:

 * Update version number in configure.ac, src/version.h and appveyor.yml to
   match the "next" AdPlug release.  This means the git code will always
   compile as the version number of the next release.
